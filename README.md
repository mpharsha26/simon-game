# simonGame
- Game's logic is executed on the client side
- Due to the above reason, every time your browser attempts to fetch the site ( refreshing the page ), it loads the associated sounds slower !
- To restart the game, instead of refreshing the page, try doing it within the game itself by pressing any key after game ends !! 

Good day :')
